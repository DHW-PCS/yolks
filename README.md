# Yolks

Java subset of Pterodactyl's curated collection of core images edited with DHW PCS's needs that can be used with Pterodactyl's Egg system. Each image is rebuilt
periodically to ensure dependencies are always up-to-date.

Images are hosted on `ghcr.io` and exist under the `games`, `installers`, and `yolks` spaces. The following logic
is used when determining which space an image will live under:
